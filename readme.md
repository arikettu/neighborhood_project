Slint (the UI toolkit) is licensed under the "Slint Royalty-free Desktop, Mobile, and Web Applications License".
As part of it, I am required to display the following badge either in the app (which I'm not) or on a "public webpage, preferably where the binaries of your Application can be downloaded from".

The other option is to use Slint under the terms of the GPL (hard pass).
